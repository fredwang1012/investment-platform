# Wealthcomplex: a simple, mock-up personal investment platform

This application concerns personal finance, specifically, retail investors, companies and platforms involved in enabling investments, and equities involved in the transactions. The database models the interaction of individual investors and companies through the transfer of cash and equities and the institutions acting as the middlemen for these interactions.
